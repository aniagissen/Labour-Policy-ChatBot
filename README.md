# Labour-Policy-ChatBot

A chatbot based on published policies from the UK Labour party manifesto in 2024. 

This was built to help promote informed voting amongst the British public as a project for an NLP based module.

Datasets are made specifically for this project and have no alignment with the actual Labour party and the chatbot should not actually be used as an educational tool. Answers may be false or may not represent the Labour party accurately.

To run this chatbot, clone the repository and run LabourPolicyBot.py and use the chatbot in the terminal.
